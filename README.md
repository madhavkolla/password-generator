### Installing

We used an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to build our webpages. The IDE we will use in this course is webstorm. We will also introduce you, however, to the IDE Atom in this course as Atom is very popular. When we introduce the IDEs later in the course, we will also discuss the differences between Webstorm and Atom and share with you why we chose Webstorm. You are also able to access the code through github.

Getting your webstorm to look like my webstorm
Description:
Webstorm is an IDE created by JetBrains. I chose Webstorm because JetBrains also creates an Intellij, and Android Studio is built on top of Intellij. By knowing Webstorm, it’s easier to understand Android Studio. So if you want to build Android Apps somewhere down the line, then using Webstorm is a good choice. I also find Webstorm to provide all of the functionality that I need.

Description:
Atom.io is the new kid on the block. It is very compelling. It was created by github. The people at github know what they’re doing. It is now also open source, which means many talented people are helping it grow. There are also a lot of packages you can get for it. 

```
Sublime
Sublime was the industry standard in the mid-2000’s
Now sublime is the old-dog on the block
It will still work fine, however, have there are stronger arguments in favor of using atom.io and webstorm
Description:
While this video talks about Sublime as a “has-been,” the people who make Sublime have recently updated the editor making it a viable option today.
